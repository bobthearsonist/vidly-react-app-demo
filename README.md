# Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) here is some annotated notes from the documentation generated by this tool:

|cmd||
|---|---|
|`$npm start`|Runs the app in dev mode @ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)|
|`$npm test`|Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)|
|`$npm run build`|Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)|
|`$npm run eject`|**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!** will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.|
